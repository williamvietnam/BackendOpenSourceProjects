Download src here, you will need to pip install -r requirements.txt (or use pip3 if you are getting a module not found error).

In the folder, you will find these files:
- image.py: contains the Image class that will read and write the images using the PNG Writer and Reader
- png.py: pure Python PNG Reader and Writer classes from Johann C. Rocholl
- transform.py: implemented image filter functions
- transform_empty.py: empty template for image filter functions
